This repository contains handouts, PowerPoint slides, and Java source files to accompany the book *Introduction to Compiler Design: An Object-Oriented Approach Using Java&reg; (Second Edition)* (see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Compiler-Design-Object-Oriented-Approach/dp/1734139110/">https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Compiler-Design-Object-Oriented-Approach/dp/1734139110/</a>).  This book discusses the implementation of a compiler for a relatively small programming language named CPRL (for Compiler PRoject Language), which was designed for teaching basics of compiler design.
